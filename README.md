# Spectator
Easily control and adjust your game camera view and angle by maneuvering inside a custom spectator window (like you would in a scene view).

## How-To
- Import the asset package into your project's 'Assets' folder.<br>
- Attach the Spectator.cs script to your game camera.

*Note: Make sure you toggle down, or remove, the spectator.cs component from your camera first before closing the spectator window or exiting the Unity editor.
